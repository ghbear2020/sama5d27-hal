 The USB CDCHID Project will help you to get familiar with the
 USB Device Port(UDP)interface and also some of the other interfaces in
 SAM9 microcontrollers. Also it can help you to be familiar with the USB
 Framework that is used for rapid development of USB-compliant class
 drivers such as USB Communication Device class (CDC), and how to combine
 two USB functions to a single composite device (such as CDC + HID).
